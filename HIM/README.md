# HIM

This pack lets you put put a carved pumpkin on an armor stand (or yourself) and
to jumpscare your friends as the "Cursed Goomba" from the Mari0 mappacks
developed by [Britdan](https://www.youtube.com/@britdan)

## To Use

Grab a carved pumpkin and rename it "Cursed Goomba," "Him" or "HIM"

You can also grab a brown mushroom and transform it into a mini-cursed goomba
by naming it "Cursed Goomba," "Mini-Him," or "Mini-HIM"

## Warning

This pack is **incredibly** unoptimized, and the _real_ jumpscare will probably
be the effect it has on your framerate.

## Credits

The Cursed Goomba model was adapted from the one developed by
