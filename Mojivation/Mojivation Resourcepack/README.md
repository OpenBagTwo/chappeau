# Mojivational Posters

This resource pack contains "motivational" posters captured from the
background of Mojang's
["How We Make Minecraft" series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHdY_46KnYtODUzKsnX_KWI4fAdUVdGk) (Season 2)
as featured on the [Minecraft YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/minecraft).

## How to Use

Included separately on Modrinth or included within this zip file's root directory should be a separate
zip file named "mojivation-datapack.zip." Put that zip file in the "datapacks" directory of your world
(extracting it _from_ the all-in-one resource pack if necessary, but **not** extracting the datapack
zip itself).

Then place this zip within your resourcepacks folder and load it from the Options menu.

The new "posters" will then be available from the creative inventory or as random 3x2 paintings.
