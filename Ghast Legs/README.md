# Ghast Legs

This pack provides a custom item model of ghast legs that can be
combined with a ghast head from the
[More Mob Heads](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)
datapack to make tiny ghast armor stands.

The [Armor Statues Datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/armor-statues-datapack)
or an [equivalent mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/armor-poser is
highly recommended.

## To Use

1. Obtain a ghast tear, an armor stand and a ghast head (via the More
   Mob Heads datapack)
2. Using an anvil, rename a ghast tear "Ghast Legs"
3. Place the armor stand, show arms, and set the pose to "Attention"
4. Equip the Ghast Head in the head slot and the Ghast Legs in the main hand
   slot

Enjoy your ~~tiny~~ even tinier ghast!
