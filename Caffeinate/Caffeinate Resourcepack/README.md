# Caffeinate

This resource pack retextures named potions as coffees or espressos, depending
on their strength or duration.

## How to Use

In an anvil, rename a potion (not a splash or lingering potion) to "Coffee"

and a custom texture will be applied based on the contents of the potion.

## How to Use with the Datapack

For better roleplaying and immersion, you can also choose to install the
accompanying datapack, which will automatically rename (and thus apply textures
to) any potions brewed in a brewing stand named "Hairo V60" or "Chemex"
