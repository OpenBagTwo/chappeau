# Moonescent Pearl

This resourcepack is a tribute to [PearlescentMoon](https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon). It
retextures any ender pearl named "Moonescent Pearl" or any eye of ender named "Five AM Pearl" to
use Pearl's corresponding skin. And when used with
[an accompanying datapack](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/chappeau) said items will yell out
"_WEEEPTIDE!_" when launched through the air.

## _WEEEPTIDE!_ without a datapack

If you don't wish to use the companion datapack, you can overite assets/minecraft/sounds.json
by renaming assets/minecraft/sounds.morepearl.json. Do note that the Eye of Ender throw sounds
really bad if you do this.
