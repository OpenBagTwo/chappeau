This pack adds various _Star Trek_ themed custom models.

## To Use

* Grabbing a carved pumpkin and naming it "Andorian" will transform it into
  an Andorian wig, complete with antennae, perfect for equipping on drowneds
* Grabbing a carved pumpkin and naming it "Vulcan" will transform it into
  a pair of pointy ears, perfect for equipping onto pillagers
* Grabbing a writeable or written book and naming it "PADD" will transform
  it into a [Personal Access Display Device](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Personal_Access_Display_Device)
* Grabbing a compass and naming it "Tricorder" will transform it into
  a TNG-era [Tricorder](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Starfleet_tricorder#TR-580_Tricorder_VII)
  that still works as a Minecraft compass
