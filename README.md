# OpenBagTwo's Custom Items

This repo contains a variety of **stand-alone resourcepacks** that add custom
items to the game without replacing the originals.

These resourcepacks require no mods and, as of 1.21.5 (vPENDING), require no
datapacks or commands in order to be used in survival: simply grab an anvil
and rename each item as specified in the resource pack's README.

These items can then be:
- held in hand
- placed in an item frame
- worn as a hat (when the base item is a carved pumpkin)
- equipped onto an armor stand (using the
  [Armor Statues Datapack](https://modrinth.com/datapack/armor-statues-datapack)
  or an [equivalent mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/armor-poser))

Each pack in this repo can be installed independently and are trivial to
combine.

The Hermit egg model and textures were extracted from the official Hermitcraft Season 9 world download
obtained from [the official website](https://hermitcraft.com/) and were originally created by Danny.

Several models were remapped and baked in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) then converted using
[voxelizer](https://drububu.com/miscellaneous/voxelizer). Most were either designed in or
edited using [Blockbench](https://www.blockbench.net/).

Textures were edited using a combination of Blockbench,
[PikoPixel](http://twilightedge.com/mac/pikopixel/)
and [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/).
