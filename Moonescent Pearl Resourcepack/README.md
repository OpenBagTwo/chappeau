# Moonescent Pearl

This resourcepack is a tribute to [PearlescentMoon](https://www.youtube.com/pearlescentmoon). It replaces
the Ender Pearl and Eye of Ender with Pearl's heads. And when used with
[an accompanying datapack](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/chappeau) said items will yell out "_WEEEPTIDE!_"
when launched through the air.

## _WEEEPTIDE!_ without a datapack

If you don't wish to use the companion datapack, you can overite assets/minecraft/sounds.json by renaming
assets/minecraft/sounds.json.morepearl. Do note that the Eye of Ender sound really does not sound good when you do this.

## Credits

The resource pack structure was modeled after a template created by
[CraisinLord](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC30GyQ6HFJuZRJdFMiy8N-A)
and demoed in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtcZhtZ0PqI).
