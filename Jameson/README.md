# Jameson

This pack provides [CEO Jameson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRNh8n69Zlk)
from the anime _Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex_ as a
carved pumpkin custom model. When "worn," a Jameson-type cyborg will
walk at your side.

## To Use

Grab a carved pumpkin and rename it "CEO Jameson."

For best use, put it on the head of an armor stand.
