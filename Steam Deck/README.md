# Steam Deck

This pack lets you turn a poisonous potato into a handheld
gaming console: one that runs Minecraft Java quite well. Which
means you can play Minecraft in Minecraft while touching grass
in Minecraft while you're out touching grass.

## To Use

1. Get your hands on a poisonous potato
1. Rename it "Steam Deck"
1. ***Important:* Do Not Eat!!** (though it's probably still safe to sniff)
